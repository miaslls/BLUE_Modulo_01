BACKGROUND

Today is the happiest day of your life. Or it ought to be. You've just sworn your vows to the love of your life. 
You're sitting on a corner watching the guests drink and dance and laugh. You catch a glimpse of your beloved. 
But instead of joy in their eyes, you see pain. You dart toward them, but it's too late.
When you are finally able to reach them across the room, through a wave of alarmed guests, you find their lifeless body lying on the floor.

At that very moment, it feels like the ground has been pulled from under you. 
Everyhting goes silent, and the world is moving both too fast and too slow. You have a decision to make.
Will you give in to grief, or will you set out to find who did this, and why?

I will lie down next to the one I love and mourn them. [1]
I will find the one who did this, and avenge their death. [2]

Choose your answer! [1 / 2]

[1] You drop down to the floor and cry. You don't know how much time has passed, but you look out and see it's morning. 
You are alone. Through the window, you see your brother running towards the house, and waving wildly at you.
At first, you can't quite make out whats he's saying. But as he gets closer, you understand. He's frantically announcing: "They found the murderer!"
